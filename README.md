Based on the analysis of your two uploaded Jupyter Notebooks (A1.ipynb and A2.ipynb), here is a README description that explains both files clearly:

📊 DeepFlow Data Analysis Notebooks
This repository contains two Python Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering on distinct datasets. The goal is to prepare the datasets for machine learning or data insights using structured, well-documented steps.

📁 Files Overview
A1.ipynb – Auction Sales Data Preprocessing & Encoding
Purpose: Preprocess machinery auction sales data (Train/Test CSVs).

Key Steps:

Load datasets using pandas.
Parse and sort by saledate.
Drop columns with over 30% missing values.
Remove identifiers and date fields (SalesID, MachineID, ModelID, saledate).
Fill missing numeric values using median imputation.
Use Label Encoding for categorical variables using sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.
Target Outcome: Cleaned, encoded training and testing datasets ready for modeling.

A2.ipynb – Zomato Dataset Overview & Statistics
Purpose: Perform exploratory data analysis on a restaurant dataset (zomato.csv).

Key Steps:

Read the CSV (likely exported from Excel).
Display initial records with .head().
Show dataset structure using .info() and .describe().
Print all column names for reference.
